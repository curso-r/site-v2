If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\n * following are equivalent:\n *\n *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.5.0\n * @category Function\n * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n * @see R.curry\n * @example\n *\n *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n *\n *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n *      var g = f(3);\n *      g(4); //=> 10\n */\nmodule.exports = _curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n  if (length === 1) {\n    return _curry1(fn);\n  }\n  return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n});\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ../~/ramda/src/curryN.js\n ** module id = 23\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","var _arity = require('./_arity');\nvar _isPlaceholder = require('./_isPlaceholder');\n\n\n/**\n * Internal curryN function.\n *\n * @private\n * @category Function\n * @param {Number} length The arity of the curried function.\n * @param {Array} received An array of arguments received thus far.\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} The curried function.\n */\nmodule.exports = function _curryN(length, received, fn) {\n  return function() {\n    var combined = [];\n    var argsIdx = 0;\n    var left = length;\n    var combinedIdx = 0;\n    while (combinedIdx < received.length || argsIdx < arguments.length) {\n      var result;\n      if (combinedIdx < received.length &&\n          (!_isPlaceholder(received[combinedIdx]) ||\n           argsIdx >= arguments.length)) {\n        result = received[combinedIdx];\n      } else {\n        result = arguments[argsIdx];\n        argsIdx += 1;\n      }\n      combined[combinedIdx] = result;\n      if (!_isPlaceholder(result)) {\n        left -= 1;\n      }\n      combinedIdx += 1;\n    }\n    return left <= 0 ? fn.apply(this, combined)\n                     : _arity(left, _curryN(length, combined, fn));\n  };\n};\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ../~/ramda/src/internal/_curryN.js\n ** module id = 24\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","var _curry1 = require('./internal/_curry1');\nvar _has = require('./internal/_has');\nvar _isArguments = require('./internal/_isArguments');\n\n\n/**\n * Returns a list containing the names of all the enumerable own properties of\n * the supplied object.\n * Note that the order of the output array is not guaranteed to be consistent\n * across different JS platforms.\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.1.0\n * @category Object\n * @sig {k: v} -> [k]\n * @param {Object} obj The object to extract properties from\n * @return {Array} An array of the object's own properties.\n * @example\n *\n *      R.keys({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}); //=> ['a', 'b', 'c']\n */\nmodule.exports = (function() {\n  // cover IE < 9 keys issues\n  var hasEnumBug = !({toString: null}).propertyIsEnumerable('toString');\n  var nonEnumerableProps = ['constructor', 'valueOf', 'isPrototypeOf', 'toString',\n                            'propertyIsEnumerable', 'hasOwnProperty', 'toLocaleString'];\n  // Safari bug\n  var hasArgsEnumBug = (function() {\n    'use strict';\n    return arguments.propertyIsEnumerable('length');\n  }());\n\n  var contains = function contains(list, item) {\n    var idx = 0;\n    while (idx < list.length) {\n      if (list[idx] === item) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      idx += 1;\n    }\n    return false;\n  };\n\n  return typeof Object.keys === 'function' && !hasArgsEnumBug ?\n    _curry1(function keys(obj) {\n      return Object(obj) !== obj ?
